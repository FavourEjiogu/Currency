# Creating a Regular Deflationary Coin on Sui (Move Tutorial)

>This guide shows you how to create a deflationary coin on the Sui blockchain using Move. Upon initialization, it mints the total supply and gives up the TreasuryCap to make the supply deflationary (meaning no new coins can ever be minted, but existing ones can still be burned).
It also keeps the ability to update your coin’s currency metadata (name, symbol, icon, and description) whenever you want.
You’ll understand how decimals, type tags, and coin metadata all come together step by step.
