# Creating a Regular Deflationary Coin on Sui (Move Tutorial) - Part 2: Publishing and Minting

>This guide shows you how to mint a deflationary coin on the Sui blockchain using Move. It mints the total supply, and keeps the ability to update your coinâ€™s currency metadata (name, symbol, icon, and description) whenever you want. 
>
> You'll learn about PTBs, Sui's object model and Transaction flow, and how they (alongside other concepts) all come together to create a fungible token (coin).

## Understanding Whatâ€™s Going On

I know you're probably wondering why your coin doesn't exist yet, well that's because all we did was run `sui move build`

What does that do? Just know that it basically compiles your code and checks for any errors

#### To actually create the coin, we need to do 2 key things:

1. Publish it
2. Call the function `new_currency`

---

So, here we are actually going to **"create"** the coin:

#### Before we continue:
- The name of the package in this example is `regular_coin_example`
- The name of the coin is `MelloCoin`
- The name of the struct is also `MelloCoin` (remember why)
- The name of the module is `regular_coin`
- Check out the source code [here]()

---

After building with `sui move build`, if you followed this guide correctly, there shouldn't be any errror, but if you see an error, go through your code to see if you made any mistake or typo

#### Your result should look like:

```bash
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY Bridge
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY SuiSystem
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY Sui
INCLUDING DEPENDENCY MoveStdlib
BUILDING regular_coin_example
Total number of linter warnings suppressed: 1 (unique lints: 1)
```

Now that we have successfully built our package, the next step now is to publish our package to the sui network.

#### To do that:

**Run:** `sui client publish`

**Scroll to:** ```Object Changes```

#### It should look like this:
