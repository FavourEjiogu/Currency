## Understanding Whatâ€™s Going On

I know you're probably wondering why your coin doesn't exist yet, well that's because all we did was run `sui move build`

What does that do? Just know that it basically compiles your code and checks for any errors

#### To actually create the coin, we need to do 2 key things:
